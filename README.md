## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/duyet/bruteforce-database.git
cd bruteforce-database

# Example: Test SSH login (authorized testing only!)

# Example: Web directory brute-forcing
gobuster dir -u https://example.com -w forced-browsing/all.txt

# Example: Subdomain enumeration

# Comprehensive directory scan
dirsearch -u https://target.com -w forced-browsing/all.txt
```

## Usage Examples

### Password Cracking

```bash
# John the Ripper
john --wordlist=2151220-passwords.txt hashes.txt

# Hashcat (MD5)
hashcat -m 0 -a 0 hashes.txt 1000000-password-seclists.txt

# Hydra (SSH brute force)
hydra -l admin -P 8-more-passwords.txt ssh://192.168.1.100
```

### Web Application Testing

```bash
# Directory discovery with gobuster
gobuster dir -u https://example.com -w forced-browsing/all.txt -t 50

# File discovery with specific extensions
gobuster dir -u https://example.com -w forced-browsing/all-extensionless.txt -x php,html,txt

# Fast fuzzing with ffuf
ffuf -u https://example.com/FUZZ -w forced-browsing/context/admin.txt -mc 200,301,302
```

### Subdomain Enumeration

```bash
# Sublist3r
sublist3r -d example.com -w subdomains-10000.txt

# ffuf for subdomain fuzzing
ffuf -u https://FUZZ.example.com -w subdomains-10000.txt -mc 200

# gobuster DNS mode
gobuster dns -d example.com -w subdomains-10000.txt
```

### Account Enumeration

```bash
# Test for valid usernames (authorized only!)
./enum4linux -U target.com -w usernames.txt

# Check username availability
curl https://api.example.com/check-username -d "username=FUZZ" -w usernames.txt
```

## Decision Guide: Which Wordlist?

### For Password Testing

**Quick test (< 1 minute):**
- Use `8-more-passwords.txt` (62K entries)
- Fast, focuses on complex passwords

**Standard test (5-10 minutes):**
- Use `1000000-password-seclists.txt` (1M entries)
- Industry standard, best coverage-to-time ratio

**Comprehensive test (30+ minutes):**
- Use `2151220-passwords.txt` (2.1M entries)
- Maximum coverage

**Policy-specific testing:**
- Strong policy (8+ chars, complexity): `8-more-passwords.txt`
- Medium policy (7+ chars): `7-more-passwords.txt`
- Weak/no policy: `1000000-password-seclists.txt`

### For Web Testing

**Quick scan:**
- `forced-browsing/context/<specific>.txt` (targeted)

**Standard scan:**
- `forced-browsing/all-dirs.txt` (directories only)

**Comprehensive scan:**
- `forced-browsing/all.txt` (everything)

**File-specific:**
- `forced-browsing/cat/<type>/` (by file extension)
